### 4. Conclusion

- Bangkok as the highest in customer interest and engagement, followed by Nonthaburi and Pathum Thani. Real estate developers should primarily focus on Bangkok but also recognize the growing potential in Nonthaburi and Pathum Thani.
- Detached houses dominate in both demand and supply, following with townhomes and twin houses. Even though there are fewer interest in twin houses, their interest matches that of townhomes, indicating a preference shift. Condominiums are experiencing a decline in customer interest, possibly due to the market saturation. Commercial spaces have a niche but consistent demand, while home offices are on the rise especially during the year 2020 and 2021. Developers should prioritize detached houses, refine townhomes, and twin houses designs, and reconsider condo projects, while also targeting niche commercial and home office markets.
- Sai Mai (Bangkok) and Bang Bua Thong (Nonthaburi) are desirable real estate targets due to their exceptionally high levels of interest in these areas.
